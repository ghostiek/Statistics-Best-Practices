# Dos and Don'ts

## Analysis

Don't use least squares lines for non-normally distributed data but instead theil sen

Don't use Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) if you wish to study fixed effects use Maximum Likelihood (ML) instead.


## Graphing

Do label your graphs

Don't use pie charts when there are too many categories (though you probably can replace most pie charts by bar graphs anyway)

Don't use a bargraph that doesn't start from zero, it's misleading.
